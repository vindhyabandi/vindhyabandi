when you downloaded Java.
3. Open your terminal and create a bash_profile if you don’t already have one:
touch ~/.bash_profile;
4. Next, open your bash_profile using: open ~/.bash_profile
5. Add the following to it: export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/
6. Close it then run: Mysql -u root -p and enter the password you received when

7. Create a new password for the root user by running: ALTER USER
'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY ‘yournewpassword'
Include .gitignore file in your project as well.
